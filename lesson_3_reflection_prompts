When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  -Remote repository is extremely useful when the same project have multiple contributors or is to be shared to the public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    -Other contributors might commit changes on Github without our prior knowledge, thus potentially screwing up our local branch if automatically pulled without our knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    -Fork is for "cloning" a file within GitHub itself, 
    -Clones is for "copying" from GitHub to local or from local to local,
    -Branches is for local linear commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    -It allows us to compare with the latest version, to track if any joker modified the file without informing.
