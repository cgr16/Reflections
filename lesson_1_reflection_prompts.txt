What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
It allows us to save versions at personally perferred point in time and hence we can understand why we did it.
We might forget to save a version along the way.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
It is oriented more for large projects that requires multiple files, (e.g. java, xml) to work. While google doc is more for simple basic projects

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
use git log to retrive Id of version needed, use git diff to track changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

    
It allows us to go back to an earlier unbroken version, thus giving us the freedom to make mistakes
